Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Overview

This project is a machine learning model for predicting diabetes based on a dataset containing medical attributes. The dataset consists of 768 rows and 9 columns, and the model is trained using the Decision Tree Algorithm. The model achieves an accuracy of 77% on the test dataset.

Dataset

The dataset includes 768 instances with 9 features related to diabetes prediction. The features include:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (0: Non-Diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

Model

The model is built using the Decision Tree Algorithm from Scikit-learn. The steps followed in the implementation:

Data Preprocessing

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split)

Training the Decision Tree model

Evaluating the model using accuracy score

Performance

The model achieved an accuracy of 77% on the test dataset.
